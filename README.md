# Dotfiles for WSL2

## Disclaimer

You should not clone this repo and use directly, instead create a fork or use this repo as a template to create a new one. ([Comparison](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-on-github/creating-a-repository-from-a-template#about-repository-templates))

Don't blindly use my config unless you know what that entails.
Review the code, remove things you donâ€™t want or need, and enjoy.

Using the install script will overwrite your configs if the directories are duplicated.

Use at your own risk!

## What this script does

- This script will install `python` via `pyenv`, `node` and `npm` via `n`, and my flavor of `Oh My Zsh` along with their dependencies.

- This script comes bundled with plugins, allowing you to take advantage of functionality of many sorts to your shell.
They are each documented in the README file in their respective `plugins/` folder on the [Oh My Zsh wiki](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki).

- This script links `/mnt/wsl/` into your home directory.
This is a folder shared between all the WSL2 machines on your computer.

## How to install this config

- Clone the repository, preferably to your home directory

```bash
cd ~ &&\
git clone https://github.com/Smithienious/dotfiles.git
```

- Move into the directory and run the script

```bash
cd ~/dotfiles
source ./install.sh setup
```

## FAQ

- What is the `wsl` folder in my home directory?

It is a special folder shared between all running WSL2 machines on your PC.
The `wsl` is actually a symbolic link from `/mnt/wsl/`.
Microsoft does not have this folder documented for some reason.

The content of this folder is lost if all machines are off, so use it wisely.

- How do I install a `pip` package in my virtual environment?

The shortcut `va` calls `venv --system-site-packages`, thus preventing local installations of packages already available on the system site.
You can use `--ignore-installed` flag to override this.

```bash
pip install --ignore-installed
```

- Git keeps ignoring my `.vscode` folder

Create a `.gitignore` in your repository an add

```text
!.vscode/
```
